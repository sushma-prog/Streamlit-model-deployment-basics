        "\n",
        "* Streamlit is a **Python framework** that lets you build interactive web apps **without frontend knowledge** (no need to learn HTML, CSS, JS).\n",
        "* You write **pure Python** (like you do for ML) → Streamlit automatically turns it into a user-friendly interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Why it’s great for data scientists:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ No need to learn web development\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Easy to show results, models, and visualizations to non-technical people\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Interactive: users can upload data, change parameters, see live results\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Free & quick deployment with **Streamlit Cloud**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. How it helps in ML/AI projects:\n",
        "\n",
        "* You can **wrap your ML model in an app** → others can test it in their browser.\n",
        "* Example: Instead of showing your CNN in Jupyter Notebook, you give a **web app** where people upload an image and see the prediction.\n",
